The original code takes a more structured approach by utilizing separate methods (AddIngredients and AddSteps) within the Recipe class to handle specific tasks.It incorporates a single Main method that prompts the user to input the number of ingredients and steps, then calls the respective methods to add the details.Scaling, resetting quantities, and clearing the recipe are mentioned as future functionalities to be handled.
The modified code enhances the Recipeclass by adding an array to store the original quantities of ingredients, enabling the system to reset to the initial values.It integrates scaling, resetting quantities, and clearing the recipe directly within the Main method, giving users immediate control over these actions after entering the recipe details.The ClearRecipe method is empowered to completely clear the recipe data, including both ingredients and steps.Lacks the ability to scale, reset quantities, or clear the recipe directly from the Main method.Does not store original ingredient quantities, making it unable to reset quantities to their original values.Empowers users to scale, reset quantities, and clear the recipe directly from the Main method.Stores original quantities, enabling the system to reset ingredient quantities to their initial values.

The modified code significantly improves the functionality and user control by integrating the ability to scale, reset quantities, and clear the recipe directly within the Main method. Additionally, the inclusion of original ingredient quantities provides a valuable feature for resetting quantities to their original values. These enhancements make the recipe management system more comprehensive and user-friendly.
